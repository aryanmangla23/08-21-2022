Today was interesting.

Woke up at 6:30. Got ready and stuff. 

Went to library and worked till my counselor meeting at 10:30-12. Priscilla around 11. hmm it was very funny entrance. Before she entered, my counselor was asking me questions particularly about it, cuz it slipped his mind. So, I typed it to him instead of answering out loud. dat was kinda funny/stressful. I think my personal statement will be good and unique. But it will just be hard to transition each scene. And it will also be hard for me to write it. But, I think it is definitely a good theme.

After meeting, I took a small break for like 20 minutes and talked about what we wanna do in senior year. I think that ik wat i wanna do aka refer to last night's diary. 

Worked for like a solid 3 more hours. Priscilla read joy luck club and was fucking balling her eyes out. And of course I had napkins packed in my backpack. funny. ngl, i get hella worried. I'll talk about it later. 

While we left to eat lunch outside, we ran into joseph and jason. There was a book sale for $5 get as many books that can fit in 1 bag. Priscilla and I spent about 20-30 minues there and we got 19 books. Priscilla guessed 18 books, I guessed 19 ðŸ˜Ž. We gave the bags to jojo and went back out to eat. 

The food was good, but the only thing for me was that it took like bloody 20 minutes to eat cuz the fucking sesame oil was burning. Even after 20 minutes, it was still hot. ngl, i mproved a lot in using chopsticks. only problem is that my positioning after like a couple of minutes gets loose and weakens, so i need to fix my grip often :<. I owe priscilla 2 bobas :3.

Went back to library and then before working we were talking bout personal statement. Even though we were trying to stay quiet in the library it made it sound like she was sad af. Then it makes me sad af. lol. hope she tries wat i said, cuz her story is godly. she just needs to muster the courage to write about it and confront her counselor on how shit they are. her counselors are actual shit lmfao. Hmm, a lot of napkins lmfao. hmm. i was kinda sad when talkin to her cuz she made it sound sad :<<. Also her schedule is fucked. Drop spanish like me with japanese or smtng. 

Hmm. One word to describe people.

Me - Caring. Priscilla said im self-centered smh. 

Priscilla -  Persevering. Even though I doubt it a lot of times, I trust that she will always come back better. She said her mom calls her brave and she can't see herself as brave. She is brave, but being brave is half a story. And also she wasn't brave a majority of her life, while perseverance seems like something she is.

Oh yea and also talked about like first semester stuff. Loss of friends hits hard. Being friends with ... and like keeping personal stuff out of it. Different relationship and stuff. Can't really talk bout it kay

Depression talk and stuff finished. Worked more and priscilla took a nap for 40 minutes. 

I left with joseph and claire while priscilla stayed behind to finish reading.

I worked a decent amount over there saying how much fun we had. Ate cicero's pizza with them and left at 9. Shawn came by as well with the boba :DDDD. 

Can't wait for sleepover on thursday night into friday sunrise at lhs D::DD:D. Oh and it's spirit week for 1st week of school :D
